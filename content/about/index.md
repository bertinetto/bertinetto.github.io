Hi! I am a machine learning researcher at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com "dotted"), where we industrialize drug discovery through AI and automation. Our platform systematically perturbs cells using small molecules, CRISPR gene knockouts, and other interventions to create an engine for large-scale and efficient hypothesis generation/validation.

I joined Recursion through the [acquisition](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/biotech-firm-recursion-buy-smaller-peer-exscientia-688-million-2024-08-08/ "dotted") of Exscientia, where I led ML research in precision medicine.

Throughout my career, my research has focused on developing AI systems that can rapidly adapt and learn in dynamic, data-constrained environments.
Prior to joining Recursion/Exscientia, I spent four years at the autonomous driving startup FiveAI ([acquired](https://www.uktech.news/mobility/bosch-buys-five-ai-20220412 "dotted") by Bosch), where I worked on advancing robust and adaptive AI systems and mentored several PhD students.
Prior to that, I did my PhD at the University of Oxford (2014-2018), where I developed the now-popular object tracking framework with fully-convolutional Siamese networks, alongside several contributions to few-shot learning and meta-learning.
