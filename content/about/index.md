I am a machine learning researcher and manager, currently leading the AI research team in precision medicine at [Exscientia](https://www.exscientia.ai/), where our work focuses on oncology and phenotype-driven drug discovery. Throughout my career, my research has consistently explored how AI systems can adapt and learn in dynamic environments, particularly in computer vision applications.
