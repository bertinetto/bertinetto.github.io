I am a researcher at the intersection between machine learning and biology at Recursion.
We are industrialising drug discovery with the objective of rad

Throughout my career, my research has consistently explored how AI systems can adapt and learn in dynamic environments, particularly in computer vision applications.
Prior to joining Recursion via Exscientia acquisition, I spent four years at the autonomous driving startup FiveAI (acquired by Bosch). There, I led research on advancing robust autonomous systems: adapting foundation models to new environments without retraining, developing meta-learning approaches, and understanding vulnerability to adversarial attacks. I also developed and published new methods for video tracking, segmentation, and hierarchical classification. I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford (2014-2018), where I wrote my thesis on Learning (to learn) from a few examples.

You can find the full list of my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UqgGl-QAAAAJ).

I believe we are living in one of the most interesting and consequential times in history, and I am motivated to advance technologies for human flourishing as both a researcher and an engineer.
