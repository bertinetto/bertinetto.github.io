** GENERAL
* The results in this archive have been originally downloaded from www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~luca/staple.html and refer to the method described in the paper "Staple: Complementary Learners for Real-Time Tracking", by Luca Bertinetto, Jack Valmadre, Stuart Golodetz, Ondrej Miksik and Philip Torr, to appear at CVPR 2016.

**OTB-related
* OPE, TRE and SRE results are provided.

** VOT-related
* As reported in the paper, the code of the vot-toolkit (and the reported performance) slightly change across the commits. For this reason, please note that if you are interested in reproducing the analysis reported in the CVPR paper with these results, you should use the commit d3b2b1d of the vot-toolkit.
* Since the region_noise experiment is no longer part of the evaluation, we do not include its results.
* Staple is a deterministic tracker. For this reason, we report only one repetition per sequence.
